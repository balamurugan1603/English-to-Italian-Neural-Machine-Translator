# English to Italian Neural Machine Translator

I have developed Neural machine translation model with teacher forcing using Tensorflow to translate text from English to Italian. This model has been trained with over 200k+ sequences with consistent performance. The model has encoder-decoder architecture which is efficient for sequence to sequence tasks. Accuracy on the test set is 87.57 %.
